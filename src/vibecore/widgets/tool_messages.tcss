/*
 * Tool Messages Styling
 *
 * Most tool message styles have been moved to DEFAULT_CSS in tool_messages.py
 * to reduce duplication and make the code more maintainable.
 *
 * This file now only contains widget-specific overrides that can't be
 * expressed in DEFAULT_CSS or are truly unique to specific widgets.
 */

/* No additional overrides needed - all styles are in DEFAULT_CSS */
